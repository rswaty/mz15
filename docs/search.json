This is a demo only.\nThis platform is web-hosted so you can simply share a link with collaborators for their review. https://rswaty.github.io/hiawatha2023/\nMaps and charts are intended to represent general patterns, and are almost always limited to most common types (e.g., ecosystems). You can use the “zoom” tool to take a closer look.\nAll maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, Randy Swaty."

We will use this data to explore the most prevalent BpSs in a chart and map, and also the historical disturbance data that are linked to the BpSs."
